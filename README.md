## ReactUseReducerCart

This React project focuses on building a cart management system using the `useReducer` hook. The main functionalities include clearing the cart, removing items, increasing and decreasing item quantities, calculating totals, and fetching data from an API. The project utilizes `global context` and a `reducer` to manage the `state` of the cart, which is implemented using the object data structure for efficient lookups and updates.
